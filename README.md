## Intro
This application is based off SRGAN, by Namju Kim (https://github.com/buriburisuri/SRGAN).

SRGAN is a tensorflow implementation of Christian et al's "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802), with some modifications.
